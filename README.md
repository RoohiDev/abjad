## What is Abjad ?
The Abjad numerals, also called Hisab al-Jummal , are a decimal alphabetic numeral system/alphanumeric code, in which the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet are assigned numerical values. They have been used in the Arabic-speaking world since before the eighth century when positional Arabic numerals were adopted.In modern Arabic, the word ʾabjadīyah (أَبْجَدِيَّة) means 'alphabet' in general.

## What is this project ?
This project is a web application that gives you the abjad number of any sentence. It doesn't matter that you are typing in Persian, Arabic, etc because this application uses alphabets and all these languages use the same alphabet.

## How to use ?
For using this application you should just go to [the github webpage of this repo](https://araxabd.github.io/abjad) (use a browser which supports JS)

## Who created this ?
The first idea came to my mind (Arian Abdollahian) when I was in the first grade of high school. So I've created the main project using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Later when I became a computer science student in University of Guilan, One of my friends accepted to help me with this project in UI&UX and frontend stuff. Now [Amirhossein Roohi](https://github.com/RoohiDev) is the frontend developer and one of the maintainers of this project.
